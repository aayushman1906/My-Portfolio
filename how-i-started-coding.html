        <h1>How I Started My Coding Journey at 16</h1>
        <div class="meta">By Aayushman Thakulla</div>
        <p>My coding journey began at 16, driven by curiosity and a love for technology. I started with simple HTML pages, then moved to Python and C. The internet was my classroomâ€”YouTube, blogs, and free courses helped me learn.</p>
        <p>At first, I struggled with basic concepts and made lots of mistakes. But every error taught me something new. I built small projects, like a calculator and a to-do list, which boosted my confidence and made learning fun.</p>
        <p>One of the best decisions I made was joining online communities. I asked questions, shared my progress, and learned from others. This support kept me motivated, even when things got tough.</p>
        <p>My advice to anyone starting out: start small, build projects, and never be afraid to ask questions. Every coder starts as a beginner. With patience and practice, you'll be amazed at how much you can achieve!</p>
